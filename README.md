Background business case 
This is a supply chain business case for the hypothetical company Banana Inc., a grocery store. From start to finish, this document describes how customer order processing, invoicing, order validation, delivery and payment collection is implemented in Odoo 16‚Äôs Order to Cash workflow.
Goals
The goal of this project is to establish a new workflow for processing, invoicing, order validating, delivering and collecting payment for the business to function more smoothly. Prior to this, the company was using an outdated system. This implementation will add value by increasing order processing speed, organization, and better allocation of company resources.
Implementation
The implementation will be carried out with an Order 2 Cash process. The order to cash (O2C) process is the entire business workflow from the moment a customer places an order to when the company receives and records the final payment.
